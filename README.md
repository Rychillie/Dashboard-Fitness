# Installation and Running the Project

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:


```bash
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`.
